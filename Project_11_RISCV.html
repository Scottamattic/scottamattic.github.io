			<figcaption><h2>Project Description</h2></figcaption>
			<p> This is an RTL implementation of a 2-way superscalar, somewhat out-of-order, 5-stage, RISC-V core. <br><br>
				Used a BTB for branch prediction, future revisions split this into a BTAC/BHT.
				Data hazard controllers forwarded values or stalled the pipeline.
				Fun features included a store buffer.
				<br><br>
				The core has limited OOO capability,
				by which I mean stores are buffered,
				and instructions can be shuffled in-between the 2 parallel pipelines if there is a data hazard, etc...
				The top pipe (the U-pipe, to steal P5 terminology) is first in program order,
				and the bottom pipe (the V-pipe) is second.
				If there is a data hazard causing the top pipe to stall,
				I sometimes still allow the V pipe to progress,
				as long as it can be proven that no conflicts exist.
				<br><br>
				More complex considerations about memory consistency would come into play,
				were this intended to be in a multicore environment.
				The only functional goal here was single-threaded correctness,
				which is admittedly a limited goal.
				<br> <br>
				I've also implemented various proper SS OOO element like a ROB, IQ, and RAT,
				and hope to integrate them at some point.
				<br>
				While I ambitiously want to implement an entire P6, <br>
				Or a DEC Alpha, <br>
				I'd settle for something like a Motorola 68k <br>
