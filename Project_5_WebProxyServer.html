		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p> I randomly created an HTTP 1.0 <span class="COSMOS">web proxy server</span>. 
			This is a specialized server that acts as an intermediary 
			between a web browser and a server that satisfies 
			the browser’s requests by serving content. 
			My proxy forwards the client(s) request to the web server, 
			reads the server’s response, and then forwards that 
			information to the client. To accomplish this, 
			I had to learn a lot about HTTP 1.0 requests in order 
			to write the correct request headers to the server, a
			nd about the Sockets Interface in order to set up a 
			port connection. At the end of the day, my proxy was 
			able to display real web pages and cache from 
			recently visited pages so that no server was 
			required to serve that content again.</p>
		
		<p>My Proxy is a multithreaded HTTP web proxy that parses GET requests 
			as per RFC 1945 and continues to retrieve and return 
			the requested web object. Other requests, 
			such as POST, are ignored. Proxy also 
			utilizes a shared cache between threads, 
			utilizing the pthread library functions to e
			nsure proper synchronization (they already 
			implement a reader-writer mutex solution), and 
			stores requested web objects in this approximate 
			LRU structure if the web object is <= some maximum size in bytes.</p>

		<p>My Proxy essentially opens a ‘listenfd’, 
			which opens a file descriptor and sets up the socket. 
			We then wait for a connection request from the client, 
			after which we open a new file descriptor ‘connfd’ 
			which handles the data to and from the client. We then 
			spawn a thread to deal with that client and that client only.</p>

		<p> We assume that proper HTTP file protocols are followed, 
			namely that every line is ended by a /r/n, and that the 
			end of the request has an additional /r/n. We then 
			read the GET request of the client and the headers, 
			and forward our own request to the webhost specified 
			by the client. We retrieve the web object the 
			webhost writes back to us, and we forward it to the 
			client, possibly caching it as well if it is small enough. 
			That means for the next client to request it, assuming 
			it has not been evicted, we can simply look into our cache 
			instead of connecting to the web server.</p>

		<p> My Proxy is robust, and will not terminate at all 
			unless we encounter an error opening our listenfd, 
			as then we cannot fulfill our function. Otherwise, 
			if we encounter an error, like the inability to 
			allocate space for another client or an error in our 
			thread, we simply cease the function and disconnect from our client.</p>

		<p>Proxy relies on the cache.h interface that I also wrote, 
			which is an interface for my cache implementation. 
			My cache is a doubly-linked list implementation of a 
			cache, with cache blocks being simply nodes in the 
			list. We search the cache based off of key/value pairs.</p>

		<p>This cache is explicitly made for our proxy server in proxy.c, 
			although theoretically it can work with any key:value 
			pairing where the key and the value are both strings. 
			The functions are all robust to crashing, 
			the exception being my init function which will 
			crash the proxy if it is unable to allocate the header.</p>

		<p>Besides the above, proxy is a standalone application and can be run as 
			the executable ./proxy with the command line 
			argument of the port to listen on.</p>
