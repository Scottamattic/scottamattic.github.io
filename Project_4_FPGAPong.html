		<h2>FPGA Pong Project Description</h2>
		<p>For a final project in my RTL FPGA design course, I created a <span class="Pong">‘Pong’ game</span> on an Altera Test board that communicated with any computer monitor via a custom VGA IP block. 
			I wrote, in SystemVerilog, hardware descriptions of a datapath 
			(and controlling FSM) to run both the game and do VGA timing signals at the same time.</p>

		My pong game included: 
		<ul>
			<li>VGA compatibility (sorting out the timing sequence to drive screen refresh was a particular issue)</li>
			<li>Proper edge detection for the ball, paddle, and screen edges</li>
			<li>Goal detection</li>
			<li>Seven Segment Display driver (also written in SystemVerilog) to display scores</li>
			<li>Controls via switches on the Altera board</li>
			<li>Adjustable ball size</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>This project was exciting 
			because most of my other FPGA work is written in a behavioral style, 
			so it was a nice break to design a retro game system in the RTL style. 
			This means that the work was written in a more procedural manner, 
			encouraging simulation and manipulation of data variables. 
			Also, I felt like Steve Wozniak.
