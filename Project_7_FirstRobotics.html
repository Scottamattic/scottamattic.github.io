			<h2>FIRST Robotics Project Description</h2>
			<p> These are some of the robots I worked on throughout high school. 
				I was on <span class="First">Team 3019 â€“ Firebird Robotics</span>, 
				and served as a leader in programming, mechanical, 
				and electrical design before serving as administrative president in my final year. 
				I learned much about leadership, and it was a fantastic experience. 
				I am proud to have secured district funding for new teams within our district, 
				and to have succeeded in registering Robotics as a Varsity Sport.</p>
