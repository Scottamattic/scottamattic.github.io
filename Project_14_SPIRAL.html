			<p> As part of my master's thesis, I worked on the SPIRAL compiler system (https://www.spiral.net) <br>
				<br>
				The compiler takes in a DSL representation of an algorithm (like a DFT), <br>
				and performs an optimizing search over possible decompositions of the algorithm into smaller chunks. <br>
				<br>
				Certain atomic operations may be more efficient on certain hardware, so the target hardware is directly taken into account,
				when deciding on decomposition heuristics. <br>
				<br>
				Simplest example is applying cooley-tukey to break up an FFT into smaller matrix operations,
				the sizes of which perform well on a given cache structure. <br>
				<br>
				I am not a quantum physicist, <br>
				but the key observation is that quantum computers are essentially linear algebra machines. <br>
				There is a lot of domain-specific terminology, <br>
				that hides the fact that it is simply implementing a linear transform, with measurement being <br>
				a projection onto a set of basis vectors. <br>
				<br>
				This work was published at <b>IEEE HPEC 2021</b>. <br>
				Where I gave a talk on it. <br>
				and the paper won an <b>Outstanding student paper award.</b> <br>

				This work was also published at the <b>SC20</b> supercomputing conference, <br>
				where it won <b>Best research poster.</b>
